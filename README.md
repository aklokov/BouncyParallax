#BouncyParallax

iOS example to create a parallax effect that bounces and grows the top image as you scroll

## History

While toying around with parallax for the CNN iPhone app, I came up with a bouncy effect that makes the image larger as the table view bounces. Many other apps (including Kickstarter, Etsy, Trello, etc) started using the same effect. So I thought it would be good to show a simple example of how this can be done. The code is actually super easy once the views are setup.
